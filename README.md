# Splunk-Lab

## Objective

Identify and Investigate an Infected Host

One of the clientâ€™s IDS indicated a potentially suspicious process execution indicating one of the hosts from the HR department was compromised. Some tools related to network information gathering / scheduled tasks were executed which confirmed the suspicion. Due to limited resources, we could only pull the process execution logs with Event ID: 4688 and ingested them into Splunk with the index win_eventlogs for further investigation.

About the Network Information:
The network is divided into three logical segments. It will help in the investigation.
